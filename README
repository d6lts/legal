README for Legal Module
=================

A module which displays your Terms & Conditions to users who want to register, and makes sure they accept the T&C before their registration is accepted.


Requirements
============

This module requires Drupal 4.2.



Installation
============

1. Create a plain text file with your Terms and Conditions

2. Do a Search and Replace, replacing all instances of quote marks " with forward slash quote mark  \"

3. Open the file legal.module

4. Copy and paste the text of your Terms & Conditions over the text ADD YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS HERE, make sure to place the text within the quote marks that surround ADD YOUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS HERE

5. Save and close legal.module

1. Copy the legal.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

4. Log in to your Drupal site as the Admin user, and go to your administration section

5. Go to site configuration -> modules

6. Tick the check-box for legal, then click the 'Save Configuration' button at the bottom.


Configuration
============

At the moment the only configuration available is to hack the file as described in  Step 4 above


Bugs
============

None so far...



To Do
============

- Add the T&C field to the Admin->Site Configuration page so that users can input their T&C text

  If the T&C field contains text then T&C field and Accept checkbox are displayed on Registration page
  
  If the T&C field is empty then T&C field and Accept checkbox are not displayed on Registration page

  Note: On the Registration page T&C field has to be read only and the Accept checkbox must be checked

- Provide a standard T&C (are there any opensource T&Cs for forums and such like?)
